Never miss the best time to book your Ryanair flight again!
This project is devoted to the Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics course of UPC. It uses Ryanair FRAAS API and AWS Cloud Services.

In order to run the application locally you should follow these steps:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
As an interpreter you should use python 3.x. We were running the application with a python 3.4 as well as a python 3.6 interpreter and both worked well.
After cloning the required packages need to be installed. From the terminal navigate to the folder of the application and run (python) pip install -r requirements.txt which automatically checks for and installs all packages required to run the application.
For the correct configuration follow the instructions of the env_setup.txt file in the application to set the respective environment variables.
